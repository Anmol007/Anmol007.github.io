<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I absolutely love <strong>travelling</strong> and  <strong>good food </strong>. I like to explore endless opportunities in the  <strong>interdisciplinary areas</strong> where Computer Science meets other disciplines.  In Computer Science, it is interesting to see how the technology improves and changes at an exponential pace. There is always something new that you can learn about.
