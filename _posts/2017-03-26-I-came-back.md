This is a short post after so long time.

If you are wondering what the cover pic is all about. It is one of the results from my Bachelor Thesis. The arrows/vectors depict myosin activity in _C. elegans_ during the gastrulation phase. Thanks to Python, Farneback Algorithm for Optical Flow and to Florian for explaining me the biology behind it and for letting me know what I was programming is actually a real-world phenomenon! 

And the profile pic is a random sketching of what may look like _Shiva_.

I forgot to write about the lady which I met on the train. So, here it is: I met a lady on the train from Frankfurt to Dresden. Heidi was her name. She was very sweet. She was going to retire from the state job. Although, she'll get a pension after her retirement still there was a sense of uncertainty on her face. She told that she had a son of 21 yrs of age and she doesn't want her son to take care of them (mother and father). In other words, she doesn't want to bother her son if the couple gets ill in old age or have some problem. She will shift to a new flat with her husband so that they are not dependent on their children Then we had a discussion about her name and there is a beautiful story attached to her name. Refer [this link] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi) to know more.

Before leaving for India, I bought a [_Dresdner Christstollen_](http://www.dresdnerstollen.com/en/), a traditional cake from Dresden, for Florian and gifted a [_Kurta Pajama_](https://www.amazon.in/Kurta-Pyjamas/b?ie=UTF8&node=3723382031) to Ivo as a Christmas gift. I hope they liked it!
Florian was my Bachelor's thesis supervisor and Ivo was my mentor during my internship at Max Planck Institute and he is currently my Master's thesis supervisor.

So, here it is. I'm writing this article at 4 am in the morning.  The cover picAnd, yeah, I came back again for my Master's thesis. :)
