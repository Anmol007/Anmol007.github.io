It's 15:50 (CET) in the evening and everything seems fine. The sun is about to set in 5 minutes. This will mark the starting point of my blog or rather _my experiences jotted down on virtual paper_. 

I plan to write on the following in no particular order:
* Weekly updates (to keep me on-track :-D ) 
* Five years at BITS,
* Work and travel experiences across Europe and India, and more.

For now, that's it. I'll keep the post short and simple. 

Not to mention that this website is under construction and soon will be up to date. 

Have a nice day, everyone!
