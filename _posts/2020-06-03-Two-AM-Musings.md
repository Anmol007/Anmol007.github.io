title: Two AM Musings

Lately, I have been reading (or having the interest to read) to know more about how a company like LinkedIn and some about Yahoo, particularly their engineering department, survived and fought the technical battles in the early days.

These readings in the early stage of my career are not only helping me to understand what mistakes and challenges a bunch of smart engineers are prone to but also how they find their way out. Most of them are from David Henke, who is a former VP of engineering at LinkedIn. For archive purpose I'll put the link [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-every-day-monday-operations-benjamin-purgason/).

There's also a great YouTube video by David Henke where he talks to fresh graduates of the University of South California, Santa Barbara about his journey as a leader (he repeatedly confirms he never wanted that title), culture at LinkedIn, examples from his work/projects he led and how they shaped his philosophy, list of books (which I will look into later) and answers interesting questions of how it was possible for him to be trained as a mathematician and leading a team of engineers at AltaVista, Yahoo and LinkedIn.

I have to go through the list of books which David shared in his slides and I'm planning to pick atleast one for coming months.

Its a tight week for me because its the Sprint week where we have the planning, retro, refinement, review BUT at the same time I'm feeling great to come across these gems - articles.

In the next post, hopefully, this week, I would like to write about some amazing stuff I learned, implemented, and deployed which I hope would help the organization moving forward with the data quality challenges.

On top of it, I am completing two years in the professional world, and I (very much) would like to write more about my work so far BUT as everyone says "I have to find some time for it".
