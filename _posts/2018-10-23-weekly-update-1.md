title: Weekly update 1| A new project and festive season
---

I recently found a nice book on Reinforcement learning. I have not extensively worked on this topic but the book is very famous among the community. After 1998, the authors have now published the second edition which shows that the field was actually dead for two decades until  [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) and similar games came into limelight. Here's the [link](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition) to it. (*Source: Andriy Burkov's post*) 

As I updated in the last post, today I'm done with the final report and analysis of the first project. The current project involved development of machine learning pipeline from scratch including: *data extraction, data pre-processing, model develeoplment, model validaton and deployment on the production server*. I'm looking forward to the next project which is analytics intensive. Here, I would need to use all my creative and statistical skills to make sense out of the raw data. Definitely, it would be a fun-filled learning experience. At the end of the project I hope to get some cool data visualization techniques under my belt. 


I am planning to go through three books, not whole but few sections which I think will be helpful for the next project. Here's the list:
* The Elements of Statistical Learning
Book by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie,
* Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, and
* Deep Learning by Aaron Courville, Ian Goodfellow, and Yoshua Bengio.

Also, I have to look for data visualization techniques which can make your plots look more beautiful. This would just need simple Google search and digging Reddit and Stack Overflow.


That's all for the weekly update.
