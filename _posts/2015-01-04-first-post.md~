It's 3: 57 (CET) in the morning and everything seems fine. The sun will soon rise and this will mark the start of my blog or rather _my experiences jotted down on virtual paper_. 

I plan to write on the following in no particular order:
* Five years at BITS,
* Work and travel experiences across Europe and India,
* Weekly updates (to keep me on-track :-D )  and more.

For now, that's it. I'll keep this post short and simple so that I have enough time to sleep before I go to work.
